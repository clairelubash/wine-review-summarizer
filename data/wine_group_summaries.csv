S&#233;millon-Sauvignon Blanc Blend,95-100 (Perfect),"[""Great colour and texture from a terrific vintage. Great layering with depth of flavour and complexity. Citrus, honey and toasted almonds dominate the palate and are followed by a very refreshing acid finish. This is still just a pup and can't wait to see what this looks like in 10 years although can't see myself having any left by then."", 'great dessert wine, golden nectar.', 'Well, for me this is the way I like Sauternes. Really a great example of the wine. Terrific honey, apricot, solvent, viscous stuff.', 'Dark yellow in the glass. Dense bouquet revealing hints of nuts and possibly rotten apples. Even more elegant that the 1988, but maybe not as dense in the mouth. However, this wine really shines when it comes to combining fresh ripe fruit with sweetness and fat. Completely balanced and incredibly intense in the mouth.', 'Did not decant. Beautiful nose of peaches, apricots, oranges and honey. On the palate this is young, vibrtant and lively with very nice acidity. This is thick with great mouthfeel and a long finish that keeps on giving. The bouquet of this is wonderful, but in the mouth it is even better than you expect.', 'I have often wrongly assumed the quality of Sauternes vintage to closely mirror that of the red Bordeaux. This and the 36 DYquem are good examples that this is not the case. This has explosive nose of caramel, plum, licorice, very old brandy, orange, yellow peach jam and anise. The palate displays incredibly rich fruits and is big and chewy yet still maintains the magical airiness that one can only find in Dyquem. This is perfect in every way. Unbelievably big and expressive wine that still is fresh and has the perfect balance.', ""Wonderfully rich, deep amber colour in the glass. Impressive, heady nose full of acacia honey, apricots, raisins and touches of sweet almonds. The finish is sweet, smooth & glycerined, with just enough acidity to add a little finesse, balancing perfectly. 32 years in the bottle weren't wasted - but any more may be stretching things a bit. Delicious!"", 'excellent sauternes! medium gold color with a good mouthfeel, not too heavy or overly sweet. medium acidity with loads of toffee and peaches. was slightly bitter on day one but was gone on day two and was just delicious. glad i have more of this!', ""My last bottle, and the best of a case. Just at peak maturity, this is very close to perfection. Lots of botrytis, full body, concentrated and perfectly balanced by a delightful acidity. Very very complex, perfect long long finish. It should be against the law to consume Yquem that is less than 25 years old, as I stupidly did with most of this vintage's case..."", ""From 0,375 l. Decanted nearly an hour before drinking. Right, we already had some great wines this evening (like Montrachet and an old red label of Bruno Giacosa), but when this juice hits the glass... you're blown away. The sheer intensity of the wine is incredible, when you've not drunk this wine you don't know what I'm talking about. The nose: heavenly. The finish, everything, just perfect. Another 100 points here."", 'Another great Yquem with little to no signs of age. <br />Nutty, petrol, classically styled. <br />Such great purity and length. Lip smackingly good.<br />White peach apricot. So good. What more can I say. This IS the best dessert wine in the world.', 'Incredible nose, straight from the opening. Very rich, complex, layered and a never-ending finish. You could sit for an entire evening with this before even thinking of taking a first sip. Gorgeous!', 'Great. Not too heavy. Well balanced. Just an amazing wine. everyone loved it.', 'loved it! wow! great nose of pineapple, pear, peaches.....nice mouthfeel but not syrupy....awesome.', 'wonderfully complex and perfumed. love this wine!', 'Every time I am lucky enough to have this nectar of the gods, I marvel. It is so very special. The only thing bad is that I have to buy some more now.', 'Tasted blind. Deep yellow-amber colour. Quite pure and restrained on the nose, definitely not a one-dimensional botrytis monster. Perfectly balanced wine, great acidity and lift, and a long waxy finish of apricots and candied fruits. Wonderful.', 'This is an absolute WOW wine. Still so young. I would love to be around to try this in 75 years. What a tremendous way to cap this tasting. Pale lemon yellow color. This nose is stunning. Creme brulee, sweet dough, smoke, sweet tropical fruits and even a touch of mineral. It is a concentrated incredible explosion on the palate. Smoky sweet dough. Amazing crushed tropical fruits. Amazingly long finish that keeps going. This is so sweet and concentrated that the finish may never end. This is a jaw dropping effort that left everyone at the table in awe. The pairing with the incredible Roquefort made it even better. Just a final note. These wines are so expensive. On a price ""does not matter"" basis, this is amazing. When price is considered, I\'d recommend looking at either an off vintage or another highly regarded producer. It\'s just hard, absent a truly special occasion, to justify the cost of this. But wow. It\'s incredible.', 'Golden color. It really developed in the glass. Wonderful nose of apricot, honey, creme brulee with nice botrytis notes. Full and rich on the palate with great balance and a lingering finish with just the right amount of acid to keep it going on and on. This wine is showing better than previous bottles that I have had. WOTN for me.', 'Nice rich golden yellow color. Gorgeous nose of fresh pineapple rind, fresh cream, lemon zest and other assorted tropical fruits. Palate is fat and oily with huge viscosity. Might be lacking some acidity to add balance but that might be attested to this houses style of winemaking. Finish is decently fresh with layered notes of honey, crme brulee and vanilla. Very oily and full mouthfeel with huge body. Great for a young wine but needs a minimum of twenty years to really show its stuffing.', 'Color: Golden. Nose: Honey, Syrup, Sap. Palate: Sap, Syrup. Finish: Long. Alcohol: 13 % seamless integration. This is liquid gold baby. Perfect with vanilla ice cream and maple syrup. Also works with chocolate.', ""Wow. First D'Yquem so I don't have a lot to compare it to, but drank alongside a 96 rieussec, and an 03 Rieussec. Nothing was close to the Yquem. Smooth and balanced, with lemon curd, cedar, honey, creme broulet, and a finish which just did not quit. Really Really F****ng good! (sorry for the expletive). I gotta get my hands on the 2001."", 'Medium yellow colour. Huge bouquet with ink and paint notes, mixed with scents of prunes and figs. Big and oily with stupendous power, delicious flavours of abricot, retaining good freshness and without any cloying, this wine had a one minute finish with great balance and harmony. LOVED IT.', 'Amber gold. Beautiful complex botrytis bouquet. Toasted almonds, honey, acacia.<br />Overwhelming sweetness and good acidity in the background. A lot of honey. A long aftertaste with beautiful bitterness.', 'Amazing desert wine. Opened from a half a bottle. Had the typicity of a great Sauternes, but so much more. Initially honeyed, creme brulee nose and very primary. But over the course of an hour, aromas of coconut, mango, and a hint of white truffles began to develop. Still drinking well even after we returned from our honeymoon two weeks later.', '1988 Chteau d\'Yquem, from a 750 ml....dark yellow in the glass with ""long legs""....remarkably this floats gently over the palate with candied orange, honeysuckle and lychee....quite remarkable....years from a possible peak', 'Creme Brulee nose with peach and butterscotch.<br />Soft and rich in the mouth, but light at the same time. Pinapples, peach, carmel, and cream. <br />Nuanced wine. Very enjoyable, but not quite proufound.', 'Deep brown caramel.  Rich honeyed aroma.  Ethereal.  12/04', ""Huge expectations, the best wine I've had, 28 Suduiraut, if there is a wine to beat it..... Difficult to read label, cork states quite clearly Yquem, Lur-Saluces, 1928. B/C level fill, above mid shoulders. Pale amber with broad green yellow rim. Nuts, apricots, apple, lemon, raisins, minerals and even schistes. A glorious, layered and transparent in the best sence of the word mix of mature and more youthfull flavours. Perfect balance in a different league, great acidity, such finesse, pineapples comming to join the elegant party, even coconut and papaya, acidity is tender, doing its job gracefully like the queen greeting her guests. Gorgeous length. Minutes again. But this bottle do not beat the Suduiraut, and that is mainly because of the Suduirauts length and even better freshness. The 28's seems to be marvels!"", 'Popped and poured, followed in the glass over the next few hours. Medium, nearing deep golden colour in the glass. Gorgeous nose of honey, beeswax, spice, white florals, dried apricot, burnt sugar, lemongrass, and some light terpentine, mushroom and earth, showing a bit of age, despite overall, being quite youthful. On the palate, this really shines, very elegant and understated, while maintaining an immense richness, showing exceptional balance, and a massive finish characterized by notes of honey, botrytis, cloves, dried fruits and creme brule, that just glides across the palate with ease. A beautiful wine, and a wonderful way to set the stage for the reds.', 'Oh my word. This was outrageous. Obviously this will be around for a long time but it is drinking so well right now. This is a wine you can just keep drinking. Having all that sweetness with no cloying elements. Wow!', 'Coconut, lemon, tangerine, flowers, long smooth.', 'This was served with a white chocolate mousse cake with raspberry sauce which my wife purchased at a local bakery. The bottle opened by AllRed was a 750ml. It was not overchilled. This was my WOTN. A medium gold color. Delicate aromas of honey and citrus which opened more in the glass. A concentrated well structured effort. Notes of apricot marmalade, spiced fruit and orange peel. Wonderful overall package with balanced biting acidity. Long focused finish. 95+ points.', 'Reserved nose, more polished but not as expressive nose than the 10 LMHB blanc. Pear, white pepper, exceptional concentration, unctuous, long length. 96-98 pts.', 'Stunning. What a power and complexity. Have two bottles myself and I will save them for later. Luckily some friends have more bottles, so I can taste this beauty annually. Great concentration, sweetness and acidity. Apricots, honey, polishing wax etc. etc. When to drink it, while it is so beautiful already? Hard decision because it will probably be great from now until 20+ years from now.', 'awesome bottle of sauternes. still very youthful, with stone fruit, minerality, and honey.', 'Still somewhat closed', 'Rich caramel and honey. Sweet, but still has the acidity to balance this wine out. Powerful, yet characteristicly light on its feet.', 'Why is the 2003 Sauternes vintage often maligned? This Rieussec is excellent. Tropical in nature, it offers abundant body, sweeetness and a long, spice scented finish. The best of the dessert wines from today.<br /><br />Por qu algunos critican la cosecha 2003 de Sauternes? Este Rieussec es excelente. De naturaleza tropical, ofrece abundante corpulencia, dulzor y un final latgo y especiado. El mejor vino de postre de hoy.', 'Light golden color. Nice bright clean caramel with hints of banana. Tons of life with perfect balance between sweet, complex, and acidity/lightness. A great showing for this wine. WOTN.', '2001 Yquem - Private Tasting - Will be extraordinary. Resounding botrytis notes, while very young and a bit tight and green. That said, an extremely graceful Sauternes with essences of honey, apricots and dates already well evident. Has a long way to go to reach Yquem nirvana, but will be well worth the wait! Drink 2020 - 2050.', '(at Quality Meats  NYC) Wow  this is glorious. Deep golden color. Rich botrytis, but ohh so balanced and long. This is glorious, pure, lasting and fine. Top drawer. (96)', 'Brown, amer coloured in the glass. Scents of plums, sherry and raisins. Beautiful attack with a great follow-through, stupendously complex and compelling along the way. The flavour was dense, packed, sweet and ranged from abricot to orange peel to hazelnuts and acacia honey. My scribbled note from the night contained the word ""complex"" three times. This is like liquid brown sugar. However the wine doesn\'t cloy at any point, and it stays fresh with good acidity left, and a very long aftertaste. SUPERB.', 'Excellent!', 'Nose of ananas, citrus, very mineral... in the mouth, very sweet, orange peel, very nice refreshing minerality and citrus', 'Red Carpet:  Beaut. viscous gold; nose of apricto, good nail polish, sweet honey, carmelized brown sugar; lightish feel in mouth, perfectly delicate; honey noble rot in mouth; long great tastey fin.!***Always amazing & I loved going to the Krug 88 after this.', 'Very dark. Very sherry-like (amontildo, that is). Very fine. Though rated as a sherry, not a sauternes.', 'Tasted with dessert course at vertical Mouton dinner at the Belgian Lion.  Medium yellow with clear, watery rim.  Intense nose of honey, peach, butterscotch at botryized apricots.  The palate is voluptuous, with similar flavors and a finish that literally lingers for eons.', 'Very intense wine. Enormously sweet, but also so complex and even elegant. Drank the bottle over more than a week; every evening a glass and the last one was possibly even the best. Fot the rest I can copy my notes from October last year; Very full bodied. Orange peel, honey, polishing wax, tropical fruits and so much more. A lot of sweetness and still well hidden acidity. This wine can last many years.', 'Really good. Bannanas, peaches, honey. Got better and better with air. Jen really liked it.', 'Popped and poured. Golden color. Nose of apricot, spice, mango, pineapple. On the palate, dried apricot and pineapple, honey, orange peel, spice. Racy finish. Getting gettin with time. Probably need to find more of this.', 'Ive had many Yquems but this is by far the best (although I havent tried the 1967). Colour is bright pale gold, showing no signs of age. The nose is very intense and penetrating, with a beautiful amalgam of honeyed orange blossom, pineapple and marmaladey desserts aromas. <br /><br />The palate is spectacular. Very complex, very intense but tightly coiled with fantastic natural acidity which makes it really bright and lifted. The flavours dance across the palate. And what flavours they are! It tastes like dried apricots crushed up and blended with mango, honey and orange marmalade and citrus flavours that give it a beautiful cut and amazing persistence, while being extremely refined, vital and lively. Is by far the longest palate I have ever experienced. Reminded me somewhat of sipping Grand Marnier, with some of that mouth filling sensation and lift  albeit more subtley - long after being swallowed. Incredibly, I could still taste hints of it more than 20 minutes later. <br /><br />OK, I\'m a ""stickies"" fan but this is the best balanced (and most enjoyable) wine I have ever drunk. No other wine has had me smiling so much of the next day just remembering it! I have never given any wine 100 points, and reluctantly will not do so now, but I feel a bit mean spirited giving this astonishing creation (only) 99 points. Wow!', 'Fabulous as always!', 'A subtle honey glazed nose. Palate was a little dry but fills out. Apricots. Almost unctuous.', 'Apple, apple brandy, hazelnut nose; coconut, hazelnut, creme brulee palate, very youthful yet; long finish', ""From 375 - Light medium orange color; creme brulee, coconut and confectioner's sugar nose; gorgeous creme brulee, tart orange, orange blossom and coconut palate with acidity; long finish 96+ pts."", 'Medium yellow colour. Some mushrooms on the nose, and lots of honey. And abricot. Extremely concentrated but very, very elegant and full of character. Kind of an emotional wine. Impressive. Some chocolate truffle. A marvellous example.', 'Yummy!!', ""Medium deep golden color.<br />Nose of spicy cider, petrol, burnt caramel and heavily roasted nuts.<br />Yellow apples, pear doused with honey and charred vanilla.<br />Pure long finish with moderate high well focused acidity and awesome minerality and length.<br />Fantastic d'Yquem with awesome power and finesse."", 'The nose had apricot, toffee, and caramel. The palate was thick and rich, and had honey, caramel, apple, and apricot.', 'Medium yellow. This wine had a perculiar, although absolutely wonderful nose reminiscent of a perfectly mature white Burgundy from a top cru, from a top producer, in a top year. I have never before experienced a Sauternes that smelled like a Montrachet, but who am I to complain. Flinty and nutty in flavour with wonderful sweetness, delicacy and elegance, coupled with incredible concentration and intensity of flavour. A densely packed core of fruit in perfect balance, and kept in a clearly defined structure with a finish that wouldnt go away. BRILLIANT!!', ""Tasted blind but knowing it was in the pack. Light bronzed gold colour with just a touch of burnish. Nose is drop-dead silence creatingly lovely...... supremely elegant yet rich and heady acacia flowers and acacia honey and warm summer-night garden air....gosh, this is almost reverberant and head-resonating on the nose, which is very rare indeed. Palate is just drop-dead gorgeous......coffee roasting oils and several variations on a fugue of honey and tons of Bot followed by deep, deep and mounting resonance but balanced by tons of acidic freshness. The pleasure was not in correctly spotting this blind but in being so completely transported by it. I didn't think that the Ch. Rieussec 2001 I have drank on many occasions could have been so comprehensively bettered."", 'This is simply the most elegant white wine I have ever tasted. Gorgeous yet delicate aromas of lemon, lime, vanilla and Madelaine cookie waft from the glass. Absolute purity on the palate; the attack, mid-palate and finish follow in orderly progression like a Mozart piano concerto. Light in weight, yet full in flavor and superbly complex and interesting. Almost too good to marry with food.', ""Absolutely delicious. The best 2003 Sauternes I've tasted thus far."", ""A unique experience, beautiful wine that you need to try to understand. Bought from the cellar of Jacques Chirac too. Thank you Patrick for the experience ( Andreas' Rating 94 / Nicol's 98)"", 'this winewas extraordinary,paired with oven dried white fruits,lemon sorbet and a custard cream pancake...out of this world,the color is a dark orange,drank from a 375ml,just beautiful.', '48% SB, 40% Semillon, 6% S Gris, 6% Muscadelle<br />Very mineral, apple, white pear, white peach, chalky, limestone, hint of smoke, excellent concentration and long finish 95-97 pts', 'Wonderful golden color - mature sauternes with plenty orange peel, dark tropical, and acid. Well stored bottle.', 'Deep gold color but with no hint of orange; intense apricot, complex lovely nose, nice spices; palate is fresh, can taste the sauvignon blanc, intense at first then a balanced minerally midpalate, great density; clean finish with moderate-long length. This is a superb sauternes and a very good Yquem. This has a long development ahead and while drinking nicely, has likely years more integration ahead of it. 94-95', 'Admittedly, my rating and notes may be skewed as this was my first tasting of Sauternes. This was like liquid gold! The nose was buttery - almost reminded me of a Chardonnay but the taste was thick and sweet. It was hedonistic in its delivery on the palate. The only thing I wish is that we would have let is rest for about 5-10 more years.', ""This wine continues to surprise me! After our recent (blind) 2001 Sauternes tasting, in which D'Yquem kicked everybody's ass, this is really up there too.<br />Definitely better then the rather one-dimensional 2001 La Tour Blanche and perhaps as good as the 2001 Suduiraut who was our runner-up.<br />The nose is overwhelming and seductive, full of sweetness, botrytis and a good amount of freshness.<br />The aftertaste is long and coats your palate for at least 45-60 seconds.<br />Good thing I just ordered another case of 24 halves for the price of 1,5 bottles of 2001 D'Yquem!"", 'Beautiful stuff. Huge concentration, racey flavors of honey and lemon with deep intensity.', ""I was told that WS rated the '03 vintage of Sauternes at 95 pts. I see why. A delicious wine w/ candied apricots, burnt sugar, caramel. I agree with some of the reviewers here that a Sauternes such as this shows better when served slightly chilled, which i did and was rewarded."", ""Really really balanced, with honeysuckle, new wood, pineapple, lemon curd and creme broulet.

Extraordinary.', 'From a half, open 1.5 days for air (Critical in this wine at this age!!!).

Cabernet Sauvignon,95-100 (Perfect),"['Opened yesterday, half a bottle remaining. Lots of dark chocolate and espresso aromas with black plum. Palate of intense plum and black cherry flavors, slightly sweet, very lush and powerful. Very impressive today (after open one day), but most likely far better in another decade.', 'Ran out of decanters, so this bottle was opened an hour before drinking, but wine was not poured or aerated initially. Tasted single blind. This wine had a gorgeous garnet color, browning to the edge. The nose was plentiful and very fragrant, freely offering up notes of raw meat, charcoal, then ripe berry fruits, which were more in the background. The nose had become complex and alluring due to the age of this wine. On the palate, the first description that came to my mind was ""absolutely delicious."" The wine was full bodied, with perfectly ripe tannins, dark cherry fruit, and a superb streak of minerality at the end. The finish went on for 45-60+ seconds. Several folks thought this wine was a bit tired and ""past it\'s prime"", but I completely disagreed. 93 pts.<br /><br />2 hours later, at the end of the tasting, this wine was revisited by those of us still hanging out. Perfect lesson in the necessity of decanting a fine wine. Those who initially had thought it was over the hill realized the wine had now opened up even further, showing off bright cassis and black currant flavors, deeply entwined in a chalky minerality, smoky charcoal, incredible balance of acid, and a drying finish that was just awesome. Upgraded my already-great score to 95 pts.', 'Outstanding. Opened an hour before and would have decanted if we had one at the office :-) Got better and better - great long finish. Still tastes like has some time left - very pleased to have 3 left.', 'Excellent with grilled fillet minion not too tanic. Purchased from vineyard', ""Fantastic new years wine. Buttery, viscous palate. Would definitely recommend for a special occasion. Can't go wrong."", 'WOTN', '16th Anniversary at Jean Georges NYC. Decanted for 45 mins, drunk over 3.5 hours. Licorice, saddle leather and faint tobacco on the nose with a hint of toasted oak. Light mouthfeel that puts on weight with the passing of time. 25-35 second finish. For the first 60-90 mins after decanting the elegant approach masked a strong punch that kicked-in after 20+ seconds. The wine became more fruit-forward as the night wore on, and the wine became more uniform, smooth and integrated - dark cherry, rich blueberries and dark tobacco moved to the forefront. Really great wine.', 'Impressive California Cabernet and an interesting story on how Ray acquired the wine direct from the winery. He had purchased these in 1988 direct from the winery after Parker had given it 100 points. According to Ray the first California Cab to receive such a score. Kinda cool that the bottle was signed by both Nils Venge and the owner of Groth. This really tasted younger than it was as Ray likes a super cold cellar. Medium bodied wine that was incredibly balanced.', 'Always spectacular and no less so tonight. Distinct notes of eucalyptus tonight with a rack of lamb.', 'Deepest ruby red, almost opaque. A powerful nose of extremely ripe cassis, new oak, and fainter dusty mineral notes. Great volume in the mouth, even unctuous, with an abundance of ripe dark fruit, acidity, minerality, and substantial tannins, this has all the ingredients for a perfectly balanced, even great wine down the road, although one has the impression that the component parts are not yet fully integrated. I can see the similarity with a 2001 Pride Cabernet tasted earlier in the year, with the sheer power and the high tannins arguing that both are vins de garde.', 'Awesome. Scarecrowish.', ""This is an overwhelmingly good wine. We sat around a fire pit and decided to open up something exceptional. I went inside and said lets try this it should be phenominial. Two of my guests had some Hundred Acre but hadn't tried any of it yet. I told them it was born ready and we decided to try it. Reviews from all three of us are exceptional. One of my guests hadn't ordered this years (tough economy) and called me the next day to say he ordered it. Buy and drink this wine!"", ""Layered tannins that are of crushed velvet. Licorice, Indian spice, gardenia, cherry liqueur, toasty oak, mint and tobacco. A geodesic form of flavor and the layered, long finish is similar to the Hall Napa Valley of the same vintage. I also get a sliced-plum aftertaste. Attractively chewy and egalitarian; with her being very enjoyable now - a little stern though - and possibly for the ages. This is also indicative of the fact that Hall excelled in '08 - and an anamoly because '07 was not as favorable for this outstanding name in Napa Cabernet as it was for most (I actually like this and the Hall Napa Valley the most from '08).

It covers the palate with sweet fruit and a similiar mineral component that is complex and focused. Silky tannins throughout. The wine has incredible balance.

Excellent wine that was singing tonight.', ""simply elegant..great presence, round mouth-feel and long finsih. Fabulous balance and composition. 14.4% alcohol but all of that mellowed out, a wonderful wine which both of us described as ultimately feminine, like a Morey St Denis or Charmes..totally different gengre but you get the analogy. Not at all flabby or peaked, but we don't see any merit in delaying your gratification, probably at its peak"", 'Opened by a friend last weekend. An extremely impressive wine that oozes class. Very complex aromas and flavors. Wet slate, dill, currant, pomegranate, and menthol. All packaged in a sleek and sexy style. Assertive finish that features plenty of acidity and structure. Easy to get lost in wonder drinking a glass of this stuff. Will probably improve with further cellaring. Should be at its peak around 2008.', 'Decanted for 2 hours prior to drinking and pouring out of the decanter into the glass was an enlightening experience!! The nose is huge and full of currant and big black fruits. This is echoed on the palate where the tannins combine with the fruits to smooth the whole, huge experience to a wonderful seemingly minute long finish. Paired with a char-grilled 2 inch thick porterhouse and corn on the cob and it was heaven!!', 'This was much more open for business then that last bottle I had a little over a year ago. No decant but I did open the bottle about an hour before dinner. Gorgeous nose of cedar, tobacco, and dark fruits. The palate is equally satisfying with a velvet texture and fabulous balance. Do not be afraid to open one now. I do not see this getting much better, just older and more mature.', ""Wow! Cedar, spice, tar, hints of charcoal and menthol and then the ripe fruit, dark and powerful, with perfectly integrated sweet tannins and long finish.<br />One of the best bottles i've drank in a while; it's at its peak, but will be good for years to come."", 'Still a wonderful wine. Close to the previous rating, but slightly less. Most likely due to my having had an El Nido Clio prior. Still in a wonderful spot, great fruit, well integrated tannins. Lovely wine and would highly recommend.', 'Buttery and smooth', 'Excellent effort from great Stagecoach Vineyard fruit. Big cab, bursting with flavors/aromas of licorice, red raspberry, blackberry, currant, menthol and chocolate. Big, bold tannins. Nice depth and complexity. Long, lingering finish.', 'First time drinking a seriously aged California cab and this was truly special. Fresh dark berry fruit, leather and later black cherry, barnyard on the nose along with fruit but so silky. Color barely shows a little age. Tannins are soft but still contribute to a nice balance and complexity. Just a gorgeous wine.', 'we had this wine at whitehouse crawford and loved it! <br />bought a 3oz sampler and followed it with a glass b/c it was that good. <br /><br />ww', ""Decanted for 2+ hours... Dark garnet color with incredible aromatics. So much leather, I thought I was drinking from an old bomber jacket. Leather and olives on the palate mixed with cedar, pine, lots of evergreen notes. Didn't get the sweetness previously noted. Just a hugely elegant wine with awesome flavors. Consensus WOTN before anyone knew what it was. Everyone noted they would spend excess of $100 to drink this again. Wow wine of another proportion for me. And to think this is the ugly step-child of the Ghost Horse line-up."", 'Big American-Washington Cab. Dark bold with dark cherry finish. Decanted for 2 hours. I think the wine is ready but will still develop. Paired well with pork tenderloin.<br />This is a winner.', 'Sensational. WE had saved, this was our fist bottle. Classic CS nose, but not overly sweet at all. Well-balanced. Classic in the mouth with tobacco, leather, maybe hint of chocolate, cassis--very CA like but with good tannins and balance. A great wine.', 'Pop and pour straight into decanter and consumed over 4 hours. A Bdx-like nose of cassis, raspberry, cedar, smoke, earth and tar. Still has that ripe CA fruit, however, and would probably not be mistaken for Bdx. Feminine, elegant and silky, almost restrained on the palate, but finishes long and persistent with mild tobacco. This wine needs some air -- it was initially a bit disjointed but improved considerably with time. Started as a 91-92 point wine and the last glass was 95.', 'Outstanding bottle of wine. May become a 99-100 in 3-5 years.', ""Deep, electric, black-toned purple red. Nuanced blackberry cotton candy and cassis nose. Jammy grapesickle, briary black and red berries, currants, smoke, tar, tobacco, incense, spicecake, and vanillin on the palate. Hidden balancing acidity to the huge fruit, buried suave tannins, and lots of alcohol. This is a hedonist's delight now, and my sense is it will settle in, in 10 years or so, to a superb example of Napa and the vintage. I'm not a big fan of extroverted, slutty wines, but I sense that the balance of underlying acidity, alcohol and tannins will hold this together as the precocious fruit and slathering oak integrates. Hot to trot young thing! With enough intelligence to be an interesting friend as the years wear by. I bet she gets pretty dumb and clumsy for a few years tho, before she pulls herself together :-) ......"", 'Very smooth, not too oakish. Hints of blackberry and plum. Vanilla overtone.', 'dark color, very thick wine, brambles on nose , dark fruits, a little sulpher...warm in mouth,very thick , explodes when you taste it,black fruits,ainise,smokey but great balance and long finish', 'Flirting with perfection!', 'Please decant this for at least 1 hour. You will be rewarded', ""Overnight decant. Red currant and black cherry. Nice density, silky soft and fantastic balance. Medium body, not big. Didn't get black fruit others note, followed with a Bond Melbury...now that's black."", 'Decanted for 1/2 hour. Youthful, intense nose of espresso, tobacco, and cigar box. In the mouth, the tannins have softened and there is lots of deep red fruit. The finish is 30 seconds long and is dominated by sweet pomegranate. This wine is drinking beautifully now, yet has not yet peaked.', ""This wine was young but very good. I'm glad to have some more to be able to watch it get better."", 'Double decanted for 5 hours and paired with Prime Rib at Prime Rib House. Massive, black and inky but showing explosive nose and flavor. Dark blue fruit, cassis, and a 60-second finish of tobacco, toast, mocha, graphite and cedar. Truly spectacular and just now entering its prime. Held its own against 2005 Harlan Estate, and in fact exhibited a younger profile.', ""First taste of this wine gave me goose bumps. Incredibly dense and liquorous with pure cassis, black cherries, blackberries, delicate fine oak and dark chocolate. Napa doesn't produce many wines like this one. Brilliant!"", 'Off the charts tonight. Would be easy to drink every night.', ""Deep ruby color with no evidence of bricking. Complex nose briary fruit, earth, spice, and smoke. Similar on the palate with incredible youthfulness and density. The palate was complex and ever-changing. Still tannic. This was probably the best CA cab (and one of the best wines) I've ever tasted."", ""Open early about 2 hrs before drinking. It had a great nose. Aromatic and young. The wine had great structure. The tannins were everywhere sticking all over my tongue. I believe it could be the result of all that sloshing I did on the way to the Vic & Anthony's. The tannins parted away about 3 hrs after opening. The wine was supple, elegant. The aging gave it a slight mustiness that I really enjoyed. It did not have a long lasting pronounced finish. The wine was still very memorable."", ""This was my 2nd bottle of this wine and one that I simply am compelled to return to, time and time again. I first tasted the '05 in barrel and was blown away but thought that the price point was a tad optimistic...I no longer feel that way, as this is by far my favorite Alexander Valley Cab - being the most AVA typical and IMHO, the benchmark for this under-rated area east of Russian River & Dry Creek Valleys. This wine was stunning, though at this evolutionary stage, needs about 1-1 1/2 hrs of decanting, which means that I'll confidently hang onto my last bottle for a couple more years, it being the last available at my nearby retailer."", 'Popped, and decanted for 45 minutes. Nice clear red color. Excellent nose of cedar, vanilla, black fruits. This was served with sea scallops, Alaskan King Crab and Gnocchi with roasted chestnut puree, parmesan and black truffle. This is an incredibly balanced, pure wine that is an absolute pleasure to drink. This is one of the few wines that has received this kind of press that I really like. It is worth the money and I will buy again.', 'From the first smell of the cork we knew we had something special. In the glass showed a dark, antique red garnet color and a blackberry and cedar nose. My inclination was to take a small sip and leave it to decant but that sip was extraordinary and I pour right then and there. Obviously, this wine spent significant time in barrels, the caramel and vanilla tone riding just behind the beautiful dark berries. The finish is a rising mid-palate spice from the tannins that plays brilliantly with the cedar nose. <br /><br />This wine is perfectly crafted from great vine and a wonderful year. I cannot say enough about the wine or artisan-ship it takes to produce such beauty. Wow!', ""Definitely a bad boy that's just hitting some drinkability. A black-purple opacity in glass, with a nose as classic as any CS on the planet. Big, bold black-fruit flavors encapsulated by huge tannic structure built for a couple of decades of fantastic aging. This was a fabulous bottle that will become legendary in ten years or so, if one can resist the temptation to pop and pour now. We couldn't, and it was just terrific."", ""Enjoyed this with friends at Arlington Club for Valentine's Day dinner and dance. Wish I had decanted longer! Still, everyone was patient and really enjoyed this wine. The 2003 is my favorite Staglin Cab of the past 6 or 8 vintages."", ""Outstanding mature cab. Improved over a couple hours in glasses and bottles. Dark red with no signs of oxidation. Terrific balance between residual dark berry flavors, casis and earth. Tannins in impeccable balance. Easily upstaged an '85 BV reserve cab tasted side by side. Suspect this will last for many years more but drinking near prime right now!"", 'Deftly balanced, gorgeous nose and a palate that showed how you can intermix fruit and acidity without doing too much of either. Well done. Cost of admission is up there, but will certainly purchase again, if given the chance.', 'You know, we discovered this vineyard becuase of their great Chardonnays. Well, these cabs they make might just be better. Lucky us.', 'Decanted 1 hour. Very elegant wine. This is not one of those CA Cabs that knocks you over the head with highly extracted fruit, vanilla, and tannin. Rather, it kinda lays everything out in a more subdued way. Beautiful nose of currants, blackberries, cigar tobacco, white pepper, herbs, and just enough green pepper to make it interesting yet not offensive. Tannins were velvety, not chewy. Everything seemed to have its place - a very well balanced wine. Long finish. Really complemented the NY Strips we grilled. This one is in the zone right now, but will probably continue chugging along for many years to come.', 'Phenominal. Big and elegant. Very well balanced. Goood tannins but not over the top. This wine is great now and will be great with age.', 'Black ink, chewy, perfect intense cab fruit, speechless', 'A very youthful purple color, with no hint of amber at the edge. Young, vibrant and full of fruit! An impressive bouquet, offering up primary scents of dark fruits (cassis), licorice, and violets. Full-bodied, but without any heaviness. A hedonistic sort of wine for certain, with fabulous concentration, excellent purity, a round mid-palate, and long, satisfying finish.', 'Soft, not a fruit bomb. Perfect time to drink - opened bottle 1 hr. before drinking but didnt decant.', 'Drank at Opus Toronto...Big and bold, deep purple with slight bricking on the edges, this was a big punch of ripe fruit and healthy drying tannins...Layers and layers of texture with a super rich and long finish...Delicious,', 'Opened and decanted for 2 hours. Deep purple to the edge; amazing nose - flowers, dark fruit- cherry like, spice. Even after 90 minutes in decanter this was a very big wine with tannis integrated but evident. Black cherry, blackberry, currant, with coffee/chocolatef and peppery spice on the palate, some oaky notes present but faded - complex front to back with a long, long mouth-coating finish. Continued to open after 5 hours, getting better and more expressive.<br /><br />I am not sorry i opened this but it was far too early, even at the 5 hour mark. Without the lamb it would risk being a sacrifice. If you only have a few bottles - RESIST....I am sure my score will improve with age.', 'Decanted 1 hour. Lots of elegant black fruit and chocolate flavors. Long finish. Wonderful nose.', ""I've been so lucky with this wine. I had a taste at someone's house and was so wowed that I hunted down a six pack which had been stored beautifully. I've been drinking them slowly since. These are wonderful wines and have been consistent. Clearly at the end of their run but still drinking beautifully. When opened this one filled the kitchen with an earthy, dark red fruit aroma. The fruit is interesting, after all this time, it still keeps coming back to whack you in a long finish. However the flavors of a benchmark older CA cab are also there is spades. Lots of smokiness, tobacco and a stewed prune underlay. I've still got a couple of bottles to go and am already looking forward to them!"", 'Barrel sample tasted at the winery. Huge fruit and bold tannins make this a wine to watch. Tremendous amount of high-end Spring Mountain Fruit with young, but fine grained tannins provide the promise of an excellent wine (95-97). Only 400 cases will be made.', 'Last one of the regular bottles. Just great stuff. Lots of depth, tons of red fruit, completely mature but not over the hill. Have one anniversery bottle left from the same year. What happened to La Jota?', ""- Garnet color with medium forming legs and aromas of blackberry, black currant and oak. It's in total harmony and has flavours of black currant, prune and cloves with a full body. Satin-Like texture with a long finish - We were wondering if it was too soon to open this wine. We have two other bottles and we decided to decant for an hour. We had the Beau for Christmas dinner...paired with a wonderful mushroom risotto. The aroma was outstanding....dark beautiful black fruit with a hint of pepper. The taste was breathtaking...bait of green pepper to start and then the fruit hits you. The finish was sooooo long. My wife and have a vertical of the Beau Melange starting from 2002. A truly magnificent wine."", ""Beth says licorice. We like this one alot. Chuck Wagner is a talented winemaker. For those of you that don't know, this blend is the result of Chuck buying grapes from 30-40 growers, tasting all of them, selecting the ones he likes, then blending the best along with his own estate fruit to produce 30,000 cases. Unbelieveable consistent quality over the years. Anyone can make 500 cases of good wine ... Caymus makes 30k. Buy this wine and enjoy over the next 10 years."", 'Awsome!', 'Black purple in color with a great deal of sludge, the flavors were black fruit, tobacco, and leather. This is absolutely great Cali Cab!', 'Wow.... this has got to be my favorite RC Howell Mountain so far. This wine was luscious, smooth, wonderful mouthfeel. Complex finish, wonderful fruit - this is liquid velvet in a glass. OMG!', '94-96 Amazing Cab. Fruit forward but not too sweet/jammy. Finish lingers for 30-40 seconds. Definate buy.', 'Damn, this was good stuff. Dark color, with a classic Cab nose of cedar, some currant, eucalyptus. The nose also showed coffee and leather. The palate was lush, the tannins are still there, but taking a backseat to the still present fruit. Secondary characteristics of tea and leather were at the periphery of a core of strawberry and currant. One of the best ""aged"" Cabs I\'ve had - truly stellar. May actually warrant another point, but the points don\'t really matter when something is this good. (Should also be noted that this wine was opened 24 hours ago, half of it was drunk, then it was gassed and recorked.)', ""Absolutely positively sensational. One of the top3 bottles I've ever had. Opened and let breathe in bottle for around 3 hours, then consumed over the next 2. So precise, graceful, pure. Shame I only have one left downstairs."", ""1995 BV GdL cab [1995 Beaulieu Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon Georges de Latour Private Reserve] (WS93/RP87) 13.5%. Wow - Just a delicious mature cal cab.

Dark fruit with viscous chocolate. Dry tannins on a solid finish.', 'Decanted for 1 hour then drunk over 2 hours between 4 of us. Absolutely superb. Deep crimson colour with a lovely, noble dark red fruited nose. On the palate a beautiful deep fruited and primary attack with lush tones and a structured finish suggesting years of future development. Reminded me a lot of ornellaia in top vintage. One of my favourite wines of 2008 and I begrudged every glass the other diners enjoyed!', 'This was tasted as part of a blind tasting with 3 other Cabs and 2 Merlots. Heavy tannins - must let lie for a few more years. Wet potato and earthy cellar bouquet with light aromas. Long finish.', 'Open for over one hour, this is a wine that will rate 98 over time for now only 96. Bottom line killer!', 'I was very happy with my first bottle. Firm tannins, tons and tons of mouth coating blue and black fruit, coffee, 45+ second finish. Looking forward to laying the rest down. I expect it to grow into something special.', 'Per the comments below, I have to agree that this wine exceeded expectations for what I have come to expect from higher end Napa wines.', 'youthful, fruit driven and smooth. very enjoyable', 'Tasted twice, once at the winery and additional one at a restaurant. I cannot say enough about this wine. Absolutely Delicious!!!!!!!!!', 'Rock solid as usual, this wine was singing after an hour of air. Paul makes by far some of my favorite Cabernet Sauvignon based wines from anywhere in the world. This being my last bottle, I need to go find some more!<br /><br />Color: Vibrant dark core and deep red edges, plenty of time left in this baby!<br /><br />Nose: Wonderful complexity of black currants, black cherries, some tobacco and cocoa, a little lead pencil. <br /><br />Palate: The flavors keep you coming back again and again they are so good! Cherry and black currants, some licorice, mocha, silky smooth tannins leap onto the palate and ride it out with a 45-60 second finish!', 'outstanding intensity and depth of flavor', 'See previous comments. Still going strong - an excellent wine!', 'Tannins heavy at first blush, but after decanted for 2 hours, WOW!!!! This wine will definitely grow with age and did tonight. Started with strong grape flavor, followed by oak and licorice flavors. End was one great wine. Glad we have a few to grow over the years because this wine is going to grow so much over the years.', 'Together with NVR 05 (rated 94). darker, richer and more structured. Big but elegant like most Levy wines. Easier to drink than the 04.', 'A really stunning wine with complex aromas and flavors that seemed to evolve with each smell and taste - notes of sour cherry and black cherry seemed omnipresent, but currants, orange zest, oak spice, dried herb, and cedar emerged too. On the palate, this was round, medium bodied, and intense with sweet fruit flavors and creamy texture.', ""I have to admit I did not have high hopes for this bottle - I didn't want to wash a decanter for a bottle I thought would be bad so I strained and airated directly into the glass. This bottle was perfectly stored - excellent cork and sediment on one side shoulder of the bottle. Initial musty smells or dark fruits. In the glass the color was borderline red heading towards burgundy brown, and edges of burgundy. After 10 minutes this opened into aromas of cherry, spice and earth. The flavors were terrific and surprising - dark cherry, a bit of tobacco and earth - it reminded me of a 20 year old right bank BDX in that way. I continued to enjoy the entire bottle (by myself!!) for the next two hours - the wine only got better. I think this has a few more good years left. It was terrific by itself but I think with something like lamb, veal or steak it would be dynamite! I highly recommed this."", 'Still a baby, but oh baby! Creme de cassis, camphor, oak on the nose. Bequiling. Intense dark fruits balanced with good acidity and smooth tannins. Finish is long. Bottle 1 of 12. Yeah!', 'This is a rare, phenomenal bottle of California Cab that tastes just like Mouton Rothschild.  Ripe black cherries and kirsch and black currants on the nose and the taste was opulent with flavors of cherry pie, black cherry jam, currants and cassis with some backdrop of wild mushroom in the mix.', 'This is a special wine. Not a big bouquet, not very complex, but very intense. I was amazed at how well such a young wine was drinking now. The tannins are very soft right now. Lots of plum and dark fruit flavors. Very rich, long finish. Looking foward to trying this again in a few years.', 'Color- Reminded me of a bag of blood, deep dark red/black...Rich bouquet of black fruit with a hint of sweet oak. Dense but not overly concentrated-balanced. Massive layers and depth on the palate, lush and smooth mouthfeel , dont really notice the tannins until they kick-in on the finish. 95', ""I wanted to give myself enough time to formulate my tasting note for this wine, as it is possibly the best wine I've had to date. It was exciting to see it progress as the night went on. It was certainly a WOW wine for my wife and I. This wine was decanted for a total of 4 hours and tracked throughout. A Heidi Barrett wine.<br /><br />Beautiful vibrant color of regal purple that flaunts the youthful stage of the wine. Initial nose was engulfed with oak and muted fruit, which started to come around after an hour. The wine started to hit it stride at the two-hour mark to reveal a nose full of blue fruit that reminded me of Maine wild blueberry jam with a backdrop of cinnamon and vanilla. This was a wine my wife and I wanted to savor, so we carried the last glass to the couch. The last glass was by far the best with a big, silky smooth mouth feel that really coated your palate. The palate was bursting with blue fruits and a nice licorice component on the finish. The initial oak influence integrated over the 4 hours. One of the most compelling attributes of this wine was its nose and the fact that it was potent enough to travel up to our nose from over a foot away. Very nice wine for an inaugural vintage. Looking forward to many more vintages to come. Well done Mike, Terry and family!"", 'On a trip to Napa three years ago, we had a tasting at Joseph Phelps. While speaking to a Phelps ""Wine Educator,"" I asked; other than Phelps, what Napa Cabs would you list as your ""Best of the Best?"" Without hesitation, he said Regusci, (Angelo\'s Vineyard) and Tierra Roja. We got into our car and visited the Regusci vineyard in the Stags Leap district, about 15 minutes down the road. After tasting thru the offerings, we were poured the Black label, Angelo\'s Vineyard. Even after tasting for most of the day, this wine woke up our palates. I bought six, and put them in my cellar. I have had 3 bottles since and it just gets better. Your know you have something special from the outset, as the nose is room filling. Soft, red fruit, tobacco leaf, cassis, and cherry cream are the prelude to the buttery smoothness of fine grained tannins and cherry/blueberry on the attack. the mid-palate opens to showcase the complexity of red dust, cigar box, dark chocolate, without a hint of alcoholic ""heat."" the finish is minutes long and compells you to taste yet again. I have been asked on several occasions, ""What is your favorite Napa Cab?"" Very hard to say, but I will say that the Regusci Angelo\'s Vinyard black label is the top contender......Find it, buy it, and enjoy. PS: I have to believe that the previous poor review was the result of a flawed bottle. The Tierra Roja was also teriffic.', 'Tried again at the winery. Just an amazing bottle of wine. Supple finish and smooth with just some lingering tannin structure. Velvet smooth and a beautiful nose with some exceptional depth. Tasted cassis, leather, and a dark brood of fruit.

I've never seen this old (or young for that matter) of an American Cabernet with a nose that powerful. The color was coffee like, a dark brown fading to amber on the edges. There was no alcohol or heat what-so-ever, just pure fruit. It was amazing that an American Cabernet could last this long and still retain the freshness that it had. It very much reminded me of a very old vintage port in color and nose, yet the flavor was pure old school Napa Cabernet. This was truly the best American Cabernet that I have ever had.

Great bottle.', ""First time with this wine (thanks to Steve Williams). Initially, this was tight and showed very little on either the nose or the palate, even after a splash decant. I got red bell pepper on the nose, and a hint of grilled meat and deep blue/black fruit on the palate, along with some zingy acid. However, over the course of two hours, this really came around. As it evolved, the bell peppers went away, and were replaced by plum, grilled meat, cedar, and a spice that I couldn't identify. The palate was amazingly integrated considering the age. Viscous, ripe, lush, velvety, with roasted strawberry, kirsch, pain grille. This will definitely improve, IMHO, but wow, what a great wine now.

The graham cracker element that dominated this wine 8 months ago has evolved a bit to help create this effect. I find the palate to be custard like due to the thickness and vanilla. I also find more chocolate with some smoke.', 'One of my favorites. Vanilla nose, hints of mocha flavor with jsut a touch tobacco. Super mouthfeel - gentle yet filling. Decent length finish. Tannins and oak in background - not forward, very accessible wine.', ""This was easily the wine of the night. We decanted it for about a half an hour and started sipping. There's lots of cedar, cassis, and spice up front. It's so similar to a well-aged French Bourdeaux, that if this wine was tasted blind, I probably would have guessed it was a 95 Pauillac without the cigar box taste. This is a testament to what an aged American cab can achieve: beauty, finesse, appeal, structure, clarity, and wonderful harmony. If you get a chance to try this wine, do so."", 'Decanted 1 hr,nose not giving up much, silky tannins, very enjoyable and drinkable style, this is not what most people are used to in a Napa cab, oak, spice box, fruit in the background. Refreshing change. After more air time this wine really started to open up. Bravo.', ""Enjoyed magnum plus magnum of '97 Hillside Select at SW Florida Wne Fest Dinner. This one was spectacular even though the '97 was great too. From the pleasant aroma to the delicious finish everything about the wine was as good as any of us had ever tasted. I've never scored 100 on any wine previously."", ""Such a big difference from the last bottle. This played out nicely with nice aromas up front and working it's way deeper and more complex over the next 3 hours. Has plenty of time left.<br /><br />Color: Very slight bricking to light crimson edges, deep core still.<br /><br />Nose: Full blackberry, licorice, some pencil lead and cherry, later this leads to cedar, and some subtle sweet oak and caramel/vanil notes. A touch of spice adds further complexity.<br /><br />Palate: The palate experience is exceptional, black cherry, black currant, this is big and complex revealing layers of further fruit, spice and licorice. Tannins don't overwhelm, but actually seem to crown the flavors to the palate. The finish caresses the palate with length that is full and precise.<br /><br />One of the better 2001s I have had recently. Up until this year I felt the 01s were in a sleepy phase, taking a long time to open, if at all.<br /><br />Has a good 4-6 years probably in this mode until more maturity sets in."", 'Cork showed a few crystals. Color is very dark/inky red. Incredible aromas of cedar, cigar box, wet leather. Complex nose. I could smell the wine all day. On the palette cigar box and spices intermingled with other complex notes. Firm acidity and great structure. Harmonious. Plenty of fruit, but not fruit forward. The wine shows finesse and power - great concentration. Warm sour cherries with a long finish.', 'I was lucky enough to be offered a 1 oz pour at a local restaurant. THe nose was fantabulous. Every aroma I could imagine was stuffed into that tiny bit of liquid at the bottom. Blackberry, raspberry liquer, licorice, savory spice, leather, the list goes on. This glass had everything. The palate was perfectly balanced, though not as generous as the nose. I can only imagine what will come in several years.', ""An outstanding wine, bold, rich, and powerful. I've had this wine on a number of occasions the last couple of years and it's always excellent. This bottle was consumed at PF Chang's China Bistro on January 15, 2011 after a long day of wine tasting in the Texas Hill Country. Upon serving, the wine immediately opened up in the glass with plenty of aromas of black currant, wild berry and sage. Great at mid-palate with plenty of chewy tannins that lead to a nice, long, bold finish. This is Stag's Leap at it's best in a great vintage. Very impressive and was raved about by all the serious wine drinkers at the dinner."", 'This is one big bruiser of a red wine. In your mouth it just takes over with so many flavors and nuances you just have to sit back and experience them all! The finish goes on and on.', ""Decanted 3 hours. Perhaps the shape of the bottle played tricks on my brain but to me this wine smelled very much liked a young Haut Brion: blackberry, currant, plum, tobacco, earth and cedar. I think this could be mistaken for Bdx if smelled blind but it's all Napa on the palate with big, sweet, ripe fruit and a long palate staining finish. I accidentally left the remainder in the decanter for 3 days and it held up amazingly well - no signs of oxidation."", 'Wow. Fantastic stuff. I think this wine is just starting to enter a new phase of maturity where the intenseness (is that a word?) is starting to mellow out and integrate into a really fabulous drinking experience. There is still a touch of oak to be detected both on the nose and in the flavor profile but it is quite mellow and really mixed well with the fruits and the smooth extended finish. This is better then the 2002 by quite a large margain.', ""Tasted recently a a friend's house. Beautiful nose of sweet oak and chocolate. This is fully ripe but crafted in a more restrained style. Long lingering aftertaste bodes well for improvement with aging.<br />I like this style and it reminded me a bit of a Hillside Select a had recently."", ""I wrote down 99 but it's really as close to 100 as it could be. Beautiful dark purple color. Nose is bursting with flavors that are not overpowering but subtle and nuanced. Picked out some blackberry, boysenberry along with soft notes of mocha. There was a touch of spice, brown sugar, and maybe even a dollop of mint. With all this going on, one might think that this would be a fruit bomb but it wasn't. Elegant, moderate bodied palate with very soft, velvety tannins that enveloped your mouth. Loads of complexity and levels of flavor. Well balanced. Finish was long and soft. Wonderful."", 'Great bottle of wine with porterhouse steaks', 'Wonderful, large scaled wine with lovely nose, a lot of fruit in the mouth, dark fruit, no remaining tannin and long finish.', 'Decanted 2 hours.', 'Deep, dark and concentrated cassis and plum fruit flavors, with some smoke and vanilla mixed in. Expansive and creamy mouthfeel. The sweet tannin was an underlying layer throughout. The finish was a long sensation of fruit and oak. Wonderful. My kind of wine. I opened, decanted and poured back into the bottle about 4 hours before its peak. It gained depth, length, and complexity with air time. Excellent wine now with a great future. For what its worth, by my palate, this was about 2+ points better than the regular Lewis cab served blind in the same lineup. Blind voting by the group put it 4 places higher than the regular cab. 94% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6% Cabernet Franc 14.2% alc<br /><br />2nd overall, 1st for me.<br /><br />""F""', 'Lovely Cabernet nose, with cherry, mushroom, truffle and allspice; solid, lovely, structured, youthful tasting on the palate, with tart cherry and black fruit, very balanced, velvety sweet tannins; medium-plus finish', 'The WOTN. Aweseome scents, powerful flavors but well balanced. May well have been too early. I think that was my last bottle of Austin Robaire, a now defunct winery. Too bad. I never had anything but great wine from them.', ""Several months and many bottles have passed since my first review of this wine and it still holds true... Bold, expressive and complex. Perhaps to the point that some may find it too much... I find it utterly enjoyable, almost decadent.. Can't wait to see what the future holds."", ""See previous notes. Plum and cassis that just won't stop. A flavorful profile of exquisite, caliber Napa fruit. The finish that just does not stop!"", ""Another stunning wine, greatly enjoyed last night at the monthly meeting of the Hickory Wine Club at Lake Hickory CC as part of a blinded '00 - '06 vertical tasting, what an unreal flight of wines. This was the only one that maybe seemed slightly young and immature at this point, yet still so big, bold, spicy and muscular that I thought all of these wines were Australian shirazs before being un-blinded. Somewhat muted and balanced bouquet of oak, earth, dark fruit and smoke. Inky black, reasonably well balanced, very full bodied and complex with enough tannins and structure in place for 1 - 2 decades of cellaring. Primary flavors include burnt oak, dark fruit, licorice, black currants with development of smoke and black pepper on a long aftertaste. Super good, highly recommend this."", 'Best young cab I have ever had. Have had a few other vintages and was not impressed at all, this was just great. Dark berry, ripe tannin, big chocolate and perfectly integrated oak.This will be unbelievable in 7-10 years, but with decanting can be drank now.', 'Amazing. Had as top tier on blind price-point tasting. Fantastic. Stood out far above the rest.', 'What an absolute winner and a steal to boot. I bought these at release and was amazed at the time of the initial tasting in 2004. Now, six years later, the wine has settled and the fruit on palate and nose remains an attack on the senses in the most positive, balanced, velvet and pure way one could expect. The smell and taste of strawberry and cherry followed by a depth of darker berries and almost a minutes worth of finish is such a surprise and so welcome. A huge wine and winner. Glad I have the case left so another 12 glorious nights await. I believe this will peak in the next 7-8 years and will drink well until at least 2025.', 'Awesome wine- power, balance, purity, and charm. What more could you ask? This is ready to go, and may be just tipping over the back side of the its life. Drink now or in the next year or two.', 'A wonderful wine, perhaps one of the quintessential Sonoma Cabs? This wine was a beautiful deep ruby color, just shy of showing signs of brown around the edge. The wine did not taste like an old wine. We did not decant. The wine changed over the course of two hours and exhibited varying fruits through the evening. While it was not an explosion of flavor, it was was not thin or overly tannic - perhaps just what I expect from a seasoned Sonoma Cab. Perhaps drinking at its peak right now. 95.', 'Still massive for a 2000, fruit, fruit, fruit. Developing and integrating secondary charectoristics. Really hedonistic, but superbly yummy!', 'Truly an outstanding wine. Still inky in colour with barely any fade at the rim. the nose is a beautiful combination of red and balck fruits complimented with spice, cedar and a touch of vanilla. Medium to full bodied, this wine has perfect balance. At age 10 it has shed its youthful tannins and has developed interesting complexity. Very drinkable right now but has the stuff to age and gain additional nuances. Finish not quite as long as I might have suspected, but truly a profound wine overall.', ""Popped this following a 1975 Mondavi Napa Cab that was more or less DOA. Wanted to open something nice for the wife's bday, so I went to ol' faithful.<br /><br />Splash decanted, then consumed over 3 hours. Wish I had the foresight to decant this in advance - at the 3 hour mark, this is what the best napa cabs are all about, and why I still fork over $85 after discount for this bottle.<br /><br />Tight out of the gate, this eventually gives up a panoply of gorgeous cabernet sniffin': coffee, plum, pencil lead, smoked meat, sweet baking spices. The juice was the perfect match for filet mignon with herb butter - featuring penetrating currant and chocolate notes, all wrapped up in a lengthy, intense finish. Will this last 20 yrs? Who knows, my last 3 bottles will vanish by 2010."", 'Almost perfect. Drank at its peak. Wonderful mouthfeel, lots of complexity and just seemed to improve as the night wore on. Some leather, smoke, dark fruit, red fruit and quite a long finish', 'Big cassis blast of fruit, with complex mineral elements. Elegant and powerful at the same time. Starting to close down.', 'Getting better! Have been drinking through a case of this over the past two years and it continues to improve. The first bottle was shared after rehearsal dinner and was one of the favorites of the night. I do not have much experience with aged wine but this may be hitting a peak. On opening still a youthful color and aromatic nose with leather and earth notes which gave way to dark fruits 40 mins later. Changed again to peppery, vegetal and a strong green pepper notes. About half an hour later came back to the fruit elements. This had a really nice medium long, smooth finish. Drank on its own before dinner and was a fun bottle to experience.', 'Wow. ""an elevator"" said the bartender. Pure,black highly extracted with a good dose of acidity. Starting out on par with the outstanding 07.', 'Was nervous about opening this so young but contacted Rosemary and she said with a few hours decanting it was drinking very well. She was right. Wonderful finish, forward fruit. Improved as the night went on. Decanted 5 hours. Happy anniversary Stacey!', 'Penetrating nose of malt, mint, cassis, intense, but balanced - fantastic, complete wine. The best wine of the evening by a street', 'WOW, enjoyed this right after a 2001 Shafer Cabernet. This plays in a completely differnt league. Big and still elegant flavours of dark choclate and plums. Long finish. Robert Foley is doing everything right at the moment. Need to get more of this!', 'This has matured very well and now just a splash decant opens this baby up for some serious black fruits, fine well integrated tannins and a looooong finish. This is getting better and better with age.', ""I brought this as a mystery wine and served it blind. I like playing this game with Eric and he happily plays along. The color was that of a very young wine, impenetrable. Eric's first impression was Grave or Pauillac but settled on a new world wine from the mid 90's. This is such a sexy cab. Minerals, spice, graphite and a hint of anise. Beautifully balanced and in no harm of going down hill soon. Stunning."", 'On a bit of a Pritchard Hill streak at the moment. This wine really performed well after about 90 minutes of decanting. <br /><br />Nose: Ripe Plum, Strawberry, Cherry and some Blueberry. Smoke and cedary oak also stand out. Palate: Nice dense palate weight after decanting and showing red and blue ripe fruits with minerality that is somewhat unique. Essence of charcoal at times with hints of chocolate. Relatively silky with tanins gripping once in a while Finsih: Quite long and really coats your mouth. Nice red cherry, mineral and vanilla on the finish.', 'Dark and dense garnet purple color. Nose of ripe plum, cassis, blackberries, sagebrush, graphite, medium roast coffee, dark chocolate.. to name a few descriptives. Palate was extremely complex, finely balanced and full bodied. The tannins were silky and the finish kept going on and on. This was one of the more memorable California cabs I have ever tasted.ripe, elegant, and long, with superb fruit and impeccable balance. A beautiful wine that is aging superbly and has many more years of prime drinking ahead.', 'This is as big as a ""Command Shiraz"". Luscious, massive red and black fruit. Exotic menthol, camphor,licorice. Mad said it is minty. Gage said it was a minty lake(a very good description I might add). We all say it fills the mouth, and is very long and wide. I think it needs 10 more years, and will last for 20+ after that.', 'Worth every point and $....Magnificent in every aspect.', 'Best Cab of the year for me thus far. Plush, balanced and elegant. In perfect form at this age for those who like the vibrant dark fruit to star the show.', 'Gigantic, perfect wine. This is an outstanding example of Caymus.', 'Opened and left to breathe in the bottle for 3 hours. Lots of blueberry and a little tobacco on the nose. Full bodied and dense in the mouth with tons of black fruit with notes of tobacco, leather and dark chocolate. 45 second finish with smooth tannins. This is extremely rich and smooth with restrained power. Tremendous effort which, while very approachable now. should improve further over the next few years. It has already improved considerably since its release a couple of years ago.', ""Another phenomenal bottle of my favorite vintage of my favorite wine. Tasted alongside the just-released '02, the '94 - to me - is more elegant, without sacrificing anything in the 'power' department. Incredible depth, complexity and balance. This wine has it all."", 'Decanted for an hour, still very tight. Left in decanter in fridge overnight till next evening. Big fruity nose of cassis, well balanced with intgrated tannins midpalate with lingering finish of licorice, chocolate. Temendous wine!', ""Always one of the winners for the '07 vintage, just a fantastic wine."", 'Tasted at the release party, still a green but has amazing structure that should allow this wine to improve with cellaring. This wine could be there best to date only to be eclipsed by the upcoming 2009. Go to the release party to taste as these really need some cellaring to reach there peak.', ""Wine continues to improve -- and impress. If I could only have one wine to drink for the rest of my life, I'd happily accept the 2005 Karl Lawrence. Deep color; red and black fruits on the nose with light leather and pencil lead. Incredibly balanced, beautiful mouth feel. Lots of tannins to balance intense fruit, long finish. Ummm...."", 'This is my new favorite. Initialy nose was quite strong and not as dormant as others have described. However I allowed it to sit for nearly an hour before taking the first sip. Extremely impressed, very ripe fruit which might have been a bit too strong but was well balanced by the tannin. There was a deep cherry over taste that simply lingered on your tongue for minutes afterwards. This was a big and bold wine, and could easily be enjoyed without food, though I had it pared with a nice ribeye and the two went together quite well. I think the ripe fruit will mellow with age, and this wine will really start to show itself.', 'Really dark red fruit in the nose.maybe a touch hot on the nose but not out of balance at all on the palate. Huge fruit on entry and a long finishI would have liked more fruit concentration on the mid palate. This was the best of the first flight for me.', 'Same impressions as two weeks ago. Nice wine that gets MUCH better with air.', 'Fantastic bottle. Smooth and delicious. Very mild. Not tannic. Not big. Subtle and delicious.', ""Fabulous tonight with a filet from Morton's."", 'Great wine.It was elegant, had well rounded tanins that were in good balance with the cassis fruit and had a long finish. I drunk it after an Almaviva 2003, which was also very pleasurable but less elegant than the Chadwick, which had more complexity and was the superior wine made in a more classic style than the Almaviva.May be the Almaviva will gain more complexity with a few more years of cellaring, although it was already a pleasure drinking it now.', ""This wine was tasted initially around 8pm at night and it was decided that it needed a bit of time to open so the tasting notes that follow are from the second day on.

Wine should hold for a few more years, but see NO reason to hold, it will not get any better. Enjoy now.', 'This bottle was popped and poured to take one for the team. It rivaled the 01 Sina Qua Non Midnight Oil that we had later for sheer structure and complexity and was extremely good. My only worry with this wine is a port-like quality to it (extraction) that I haven\'t noticed in other young QCs. There was not any detectable heat. The ""port-like"" quality be the one attribute that people are loving but I find it hard to extrapolate how it will age. Quite different from previous QC wines.', ""This wine would be somewhere between a mature Chapoutier Cote-Rotie La Modoree and a mature Haut Brion with a dollop of Napa fruit. Specifically, if you mix the roasted herbed meat characteristics of great La Modoree with the smoky fine texture of a Haut Brion you would end up with something akin to this wine. 23 years later, the wine still has signature Napa fruit. One of the striking features was this wine's integrity. From beginning to end, the wine's texture was smooth, mature, and elicited responses from all taste buds. My dinner companion who is from Napa said it smelled like the very end of a Napan Indian Summer. The wine continued to gain complexity in the glass over the course of the evening."", ""Decanted for one hour. Bottle in excellent shape, even was wrapped in original tissue. Fill well into the neck. Ominously dark core, that's garnet. The rim is lighter and a little crystal as well. Exemplary nose of currant paste, loamy cherry, tobacco leaf, volcanic rock and cedar. Napa meets Paulliac in a lot of ways. I also sense a little of a Barolo-like palate as well. Alluring body that's not full, so much as complete. There's an elegant and evolving finnish that is a minute plus. Intricately soft tannins and the perfect amount of acidity. The palate overall is actually quite round, with a soft finnish.

This kept evolving in the glass and I kept going back to it. On the palate, the complexity and depth of the nose came through very well. It showed the sweet red and black fruits, with fantastic balance and length - the finish just kept going and going. This is still bold and vibrant and has a good underlying acidity keeping it fresh.

The middle has the same, sweet tobacco-like tinge with darker fruit like blackberry. The wine ends for what seems like forever, tapering off with next to no tannin, just a gorgeous fade to black from it's sharpest peak in the middle of the profile (like slightly overripe green grapes).

Wow, this is pure and precise with tones of refined black fruits of currant, blackberry and black plum. Some real nice cola notes amidst some tar, cardamom and soy. I kept this in my glass all night. It evolved, but in the super-flight at the end of the night, my new pour seemed a bit tired and fading.

Then I pulled the cork on this bad boy and thus began my adventure...<br /><br />I got my first waft before I could insert the pourer into the neck. Faint, but a sweet concentrate of black fruits, always a good sign. I was nervous about this bottle because it was purchased on WineBid for the same price as the current vintage of Old Sparky was being sold to the mailing list. Best buy ever!!! I started decanting this very lightly into the side of the decanter for minimal oxygenation (it's a magnum and since I only share Old Sparky's with my wife we had to siphon off half of it for the next day), stopping as soon as I began to see sediment enter the stream through the crystal pourer (SOP). Unfortunately this left around 3 ounces in the bottle! With a current retail value of about $22/ounce I wasn't about to just pour it out. So I got a natural, unbleached tea filter bag and poured the dregs through that. The deep, hazy purple emulsion that emerged was so soft, velvety, full of ripe black fruts and balanced that it merited a 93+ score of it's own with no decant! THE DREGS!!! Un-be-lievable! I poured half the decanter into a separate bottle so we could sin and have it with In-And-Out burgers the next day.<br /><br />After a 4-hour decant this coalesced into Schrader magic. A voluptuous, seductive and hedonistic bombshell in my glass!!! (Apologies for all the exclamation points, but hey). Even in this huge bowl (Riedel Sommelier Series Grand Cru Bordeaux) the nose wafts out 6 inches beyond the rim. The nose is rich with blackberry jam, grilled black plum, black currant, cassis, melted brown sugar, oiled leather, hints of nutmeg/cinnamon/cracked black pepper, 60% dark cocoa powder (is that Rutherford dust?) all poured over hot cracked granite. Mouth is rich with blackberry liqueur, raspberry jam, creme de cassis, velvety tannins, superfine and sweet, just ever so slightly rough and subtle heat. It feels like a high-quality raspberry-infused dark chocolate bar melting on my tongue. This is in such a sweet spot, so fully present and gratifying that it's unbelievable. The wine just kept adding nuances over time and it was mind-blowing. Tasting history here folks! Finish is a real yin & yang of black fruits and dark chocolate for the first 20 seconds. It goes on for 60 seconds and the dark chocolate wins. Such a wonderful melange, so balanced. Without that hint of heat it would be a 96+ wine for me.<br /><br />For you diehards that read this far, it was still great the next day, but the heat was slightly more pronounced.

He started with a salad of tomatoes with red wine vinegar, red onions, and plenty of blue cheese crumbles. I had a salad of tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil and balsamic vinegar. For dinner I grilled thick ribeye steaks, and made skillet potatoes with caramelized onions, garlic and cherry peppers. The wine paired beautifully with both salads, particularly the mozzarella in my salad, which surprised me. It seemed to be an obvious choice for the ribeye and potatoes and we were not disappointed. The wine had a beautiful bouquet, and prior to each sip, we lingered on the wonderful aroma.

However, over the course of 3.5 hours this stuff strutted in a big way, unveiling sweeping, dusty tannins and a huge finish with stunning complexity. The nose shows cassis with a hint of mint and smokey notes in the background. On the palate this is the essence of toffee, roasted plum, brown sugar and blackberry. Wow, this is gorgeous and threads the needle so well between being structured and black on one side and sweet, complex and approachable on the other.

Pretty decent on the palate too. Rather dominated by high acidity, but there was plenty of fruit, moving from more sweet floaty strawberry and flowers on the attack to raspberry cream and morello cherry notes on the mid-palate, with little bits of spice and mineral bobbing around.

Mais le tout manque de gourmandise et ne satisfait pas l'amateur de bojo joufflu et festif en moi."", 'Nice enough, though ... still Beaujoulais. Not terribly excited.', 'Nose is sweet candied fruit, think Runts, also hints of banana. Flavor is sweet red fruit with a medium length tart finish.', ""There wasn't anything offputting about this bottle. Perhaps I'm just not a fan of the gamay grape. It had good acidity and the fruit was vibrant. It was just fairly simple and not anything I'd run to get again."", ""pretty light, but i think this is my first beaujolais, so i'm not sure what its *supposed* to taste like. oddly got more heat on the second day. light flavors of plum, and a rather light red color in general. the back finished stronger with cherry? and a hint of chocolate. i liked it a fair bit for the price (9 dollars or so at costco) and would get it again as i think it stands well on its own, and would pair with dishes in a versataile manner."", 'Appearance: Bright and clear, of medium intensity purple color with paler rims and legs<br />Nose: Clean, with medium intensity and youthful aromas of raspberry, sweet red cherries, fresh plum, strawberry, cranberry, bubble gum and banana.<br />Palate: Dry, with medium acidity and medium (-) tannin which is resolved and silky. Medium in alcohol level, this wine has a medium (-) body with medium (-) intensity flavors of raspberry, cranberry, red cherries, strawberry and black pepper. The finish is medium (-) in length.<br />Conclusion: Acceptable level Beaujolais entry-level village wine, with typical Gamay characters of low tannin and light-bodied, plus clear carbonic maceration evidence. The nose is reasonably intense though the palate is weaker. Fairly simple overall, the length is quite short but the wine is still in balance. Ready to drink now and not intend for further ageing.', 'Really enjoyable. Light, refreshing perfect for summer.', 'Were past the harvest plus two years after which no Beaujolais can deliver full and fruity drama, but it still comes as a slight surprise that this famous cuvee is so light. Thats 2007 though. This is Cote-de-Beaune Beaujolais: clean, gentle aromatics of musky strawberry. Well-knit, small-scale-plush (round tannins, and less acidity that most Beauj and many Burg), pure and fairly long, this should make nice drinking for another 2+ years. I like the way the nose shimmers; could get more pungent, and the wine more elegant, soon. 89+ now.', 'I would say that the price is right, but other than that, nothing to get excited about', ""I don't know what's up here, but everytime I taste this wine I like it less than I previously did. It's very good, but last night in a blind tasting of BEaujolais it did not show well."", 'Candied cherries with a hint of minerals. Straightforward and pleasant--in my mind what a Beaujolais should be. Not a wine to sit and contemplate, but one to drink. Enjoyed it.', 'Light ruby/violet color. Intense nose of grilled meat, strawberry, damp earth. Very alluring and strong. On the palate it is a bit weaker, a little empty on the mid-palate with dry tannins. May need a couple of years in bottle to come around.', 'Tasted at LIWF 2009<br /><br />Medium plum/garnet colour; Smoky mineral nose - quite subtle and restrained; Nice palate - smooth elegant fruit. Very nice wine.', 'Greatly preferred the other 09 Beaujolais we had, but this was the last wine tasted (of 5), so it may not have been given a fair chance. Still a good bottle, but not a re-buy at $22.', 'Good beaujolais, Fruity and soft, strawberry, with nice acidity and typical gamay-ness.', 'Not as fruity as the previous bottle, suggesting like much Beaujolais the need to drink early. Still, not a bad drop and retaining much more of that Burgundian earthiness, even barnyard aromas.', 'Medium to light red in color. Simple, fruity, easy to understand, soft wine. No tannins to speak of. Nothing green or harsh here, but nothing very profound either.', ""Vibrant cherry-ruby color. Vibrant aromas of black cherries, dark loamy soils, hints of bitter chocolate. The palate has a lot of tangy acid, along with grippy tannins. Flavors of pure cherries, minerals, cocoa and graphite. It's very complex and could age for ten years easily. Solid stuff!"", ""Really liking all the '09 Beaujolais I've had so far. This was fruity and light and got better the 2nd day. At opening it smelled a little bit too fake but that blew off quickly and drank nicely."", 'Clear, medium intense, purple, legs, fades to rim.<br />Clean, pronounced nose, fruit, strewberry, black berry, <br />Med acid, nice fruit on pallette, good length, soft fruits, very light tannins.<br />Very good Boujolais, fruity, lovelly chilled.', 'Bright ruby in color. Pronounced aromas of black cherry with some alcoholic heat. On the palate, more black cherries, some mint or herbs, and a bit of barnyard funk. More complex than many gamay, but a bit disjointed with a slightly bitter finish.', ""Already shedding some of an earlier bottle's firmness, this is the perfect party wine, especially as poured from magnum. Inexpensive, deeply colored, unusual enough to perk up the geeks, not so foreign to discourage the novices."", 'Started off a bit austere, but after an hour of so developed some of stony minerals, cherry and verve that I remember from before. Seems like some 2009s are closing down a bit compared to their approachability of just a couple months ago.', ""Trs joli en attaque avec son fruit et sa texture dlicate, sa fine minralit. Il y a cependant une chaleur en finale due  l'alcool, qui dtonne avec un vin autrement si fin et qui n'tait pas apparente il y a un an. 89 pts""]",87.19186046511628,"[1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011]",172,This is a far more tannic and acidic wine than I expected. Right now it tastes like a Pinot barrel sample. An amazing 15.8% alcohol here as a result of the 2003 heat wave. An incredible nosegay of geraniums and mint. Lots of strawberries and red fruits. Easy drinking and enjoyable.
